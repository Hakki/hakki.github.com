*On Windows 7, running Ubuntu, using VirtualBox*
--------------------------------------------
<ol>
<li> Get a computer that is somewhat powerful. Because running Ubuntu on VirtualBox takes quite a bit of RAM. </li>
<li> Then go to github.com and sign up for the free account. Yes, this is very obvious, however it is the first step.</li>
<li> Your next step should be to install VirtualBox. Just Google it and you will find it.</li>
<li> Then I found Linux Ubuntu 10.10 using Google. Download it and start running it using the VirtualBox. To do this, open Oracle VM VirtualBox, click on the New tab on the top left corner. It's a blue circle shape that kind of looks like a sun. But it's blue. From there follow the instructions. When youâ€™re done, go to Setting, the sign next to the blue sun that says New. Go to Storage tab, then on the right side click on the CD picture and find where your Linux Ubuntu 10.10 is. After that check Live CD/DVD box and say ok. From there you can start running your Linux Ubuntu 10.10 using your VirtualBox!!! :) getting excited yet? I WAS!</li>
<li> When you start running the software you will need to set up Ubuntu the first time. It might take a while depending on your computer. I had to ignore all the updates when i was done. Because the first time I did the updates it crashed and did not work.</li>
<li> Next you need to install the guest editor. Which will allow you to do the Seamless Mode. Which is AWESOME!</li>
